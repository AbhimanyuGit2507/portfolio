# PORTFOLIO
Link: [Portfolio](https://abhimanyugit2507.github.io/portfolio/)

This portfolio is a personal website designed to showcase my work, skills, and background.
It was built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and a small amount of **JavaScript** for the typewriter effect on the homepage.

Each part of the site highlights different aspects of my profile:

* **Home:** Introduces me with a typewriter animation and profile image.
* **Skills:** Displays my technical skills such as Python, Django, FastAPI, JavaScript, and Google Apps Script.
* **Projects:** Lists the main projects I’ve built, including Border Watch (hackathon project), QuoteBot (B2B automation tool), and others.
* **Socials:** Provides links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Fiverr profiles.
* **Contact:** Includes a simple form for visitors to send messages.

The website is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts automatically for different screen sizes such as desktops, tablets, and phones.
